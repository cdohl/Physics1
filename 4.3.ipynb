    "### 4.3.1 Elastic forces, spring force\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear spring generates a restoring force that is linear to the deflection $x$. The direction of the force is opposite to the deflection, which explains the negative sign in equation (4.3.1).\n",

    "$$\\vec{F}_F=-k\\,x\\,\\vec{e}_x\\tag{4.3.1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "An elastic force is independent of the path taken for the deflection (only on the total deflection). This type of force is called a conservative force.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3.2 Friction\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the force resisting the relative motion of solid surfaces sliding against each other:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Static friction ($\\vec{v}=0$), d.h. the body remains at rest)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/4.3_2.png\" width=270px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The static friction resists the applied force up to a maximum value. As long as this maximum value is not reached, the body remains at rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{R}+\\vec{F}=0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A normal force $\\vec{F}_N=m\\,g\\,\\vec{e}_y$ acts on the body, and only this determines the maximum static friction through a static friction coefficient $\\mu_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{R,max}=\\mu_0\\,F_N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum static friction and thus the coefficient of friction can be easily determined on an inclined plane\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/4.3_3.png\" width=270px>\n",
    "\n",
    "The force that moves the body downwards is \n",
    "$$F=m\\,g\\sin\\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the normal force\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_N=m\\,g\\,\\cos\\alpha\\quad .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maximum static friction force is $F_{R,max}=-\\mu_0\\,F_N$. This means that once the force on the body is greater than $\\left|F_{R,max}\\right|$, then the body slides. Sliding therefore starts when\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|F\\right|=\\left|F_{R,max}\\right|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m\\,g\\,\\sin\\alpha=\\mu_0\\,F_N=\\mu_0\\,m\\,g\\cos\\alpha$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tan\\alpha=\\mu_0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sliding friction\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the body moves at a velocity $\\vec{v}=v\\,\\vec{e}_v$, the dynamic frictional force acts on the body. This force points opposite to the direction of the velocity $\\vec{e}_v$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/4.3_4.png\" width=270px>\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{GL}=-\\mu_{GL}\\left|\\vec{F}_N\\right|\\vec{e}_v$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit vector can also be expressed as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{e}_v=\\frac{\\vec{v}}{\\left|\\vec{v}\\right|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and thus\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}_{GL}=-\\mu_{GL}\\left|\\vec{F}_N\\right|\\frac{\\vec{v}}{\\left|\\vec{v}\\right|}\\quad .$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$F_{GL}$ is independent of the magnitude of $\\vec{v}$."
