    "\n",
    "The momentum of a body is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{p}=m\\,\\vec{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the unit is $\\left[p\\right]$=kg m s$^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A force must act for a change in momentum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{F}=m\\,\\vec{a}=m\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{v}}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\left(m\\,\\vec{v}\\right)}{\\mathrm{d}t}=\n",
    "\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\vec{p}}{\\mathrm{d}t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if no force acts on a body, the momentum remains constant. We can extend the concept of momentum to system of point masses. The total momentum results from the vector addition of the individual momenta $\\vec{p}_i$, i.e.\n",

    "$$\\vec{p}_{ges}=\\sum_i \\vec{p}_i=\\sum_i m_i\\vec{v}_i$$\n",

    "There applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b> In a closed system in which only internal forces act, the total momentum $p_{ges}$ remains constant.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal forces are the forces between the bodies of the system. External forces act on the system from the outside. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "We consider the movement of a closed system  on a frictionless support. Initially, two masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ are connected with a spring under a spring force via a cable. The masses are at rest, so the total momentum is $p_{ges}=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figures/7.1_1.png\" width=450px>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the rope is cut and the masses move apart. No external forces act, the total momentum remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_{ges}=m_1\\,\\vec{v_1}+m_2\\,\\vec{v_2}=0\\tag{7.1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The movement is one-dimensional $\\vec{v_1}=v_1\\vec{e}_x$ and $\\vec{v_2}=v_2\\vec{e}_x$, therefore applies:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left|\\frac{v_1}{v_2}\\right|=\\frac{m_2}{m_1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If both masses are equal, $m_1$ and $m_2$ move away from each other with the same amount of velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can further transform Eq. (7.1):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_1\\,v_1+m_2\\,v_2=p_{ges}\\tag{7.2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$p_{ges}$ was zero in the above example, but in general for a system it can assume any constant value.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",

    "#### Center of mass\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression in the brackets in Eq. (7.4) is constant in time and is therefore called a *conservation quantity*. $x_s$ is a coordinate (with unit length) and points to the center of mass of the closed system. In general, it follows from the conservation of momentum that <b>the center of mass $\\vec{r}_s$ of the closed system remains constant</b>.\n",
